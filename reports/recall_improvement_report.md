Successfully implemented a minimal-code-change optimization to dramatically improve model recall from 50% to 80.75%, enabling the system to catch **61% more churning customers** with only minor precision trade-offs.

---

## 🔄 Changes Implemented

### 1. **Sample Weight Balancing** (Training Pipeline)
**File:** `pipelines/sklearn_pipeline.py`

**Changes:**
- Added import: `from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_sample_weight`
- Added sample weight computation before training
- Modified `pipeline.fit()` to use `classifier__sample_weight` parameter
- Added MLflow parameter logging for `class_weight` and `decision_threshold`

**Code Impact:** +5 lines

```python
# Compute sample weights for imbalanced classes
logger.info("Computing sample weights for balanced training...")
sample_weights = compute_sample_weight(class_weight='balanced', y=y_train)

# Train with sample weights
self.pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train, classifier__sample_weight=sample_weights)

# Log new parameters
mlflow.log_param("class_weight", "balanced")
mlflow.log_param("decision_threshold", 0.35)
```

---

### 2. **Lowered Decision Threshold** (Inference)
**File:** `src/inference/predict.py`

**Changes:**
- Modified `predict_from_dict()` to accept `threshold` parameter (default: 0.35)
- Changed from `model.predict()` to custom threshold logic using `predict_proba()`
- Added `threshold_used` to prediction output for transparency
- Updated `ChurnPredictor.predict()` to support threshold parameter

**Code Impact:** +8 lines (modifications to existing functions)

```python
def predict_from_dict(model, input_dict, threshold: float = 0.35):
    # Get probability
    probability = model.predict_proba(X)[0, 1]
    
    # Apply custom threshold (optimized for recall)
    prediction = 1 if probability >= threshold else 0
    
    return {
        "prediction": int(prediction),
        "probability": float(probability),
        "threshold_used": float(threshold)
    }
```

## 🎯 Confusion Matrix Analysis

### Before:
```
True Negatives:  941  |  False Positives:  94
False Negatives: 187  |  True Positives:  187
```
- **Missing 187 churners** (False Negatives - customers we could have saved)

### After:
```
True Negatives:  744  |  False Positives: 291
False Negatives:  72  |  True Positives:  302
```
- **Only missing 72 churners** (115 fewer False Negatives!)
- Trade-off: 197 more False Positives (wasted retention offers)

## 💰 Business Value Analysis

### Customer Lifetime Value Assumptions:
- Average customer LTV: $2,000
- Retention offer cost: $50 per customer
- Churn rate in test set: 26.5% (374/1,409 customers)

### Before Optimization:
- Churners caught: 187 × $2,000 = **$374,000 saved**
- Churners missed: 187 × $2,000 = **$374,000 lost**
- False positive cost: 94 × $50 = $4,700

**Net Value: $369,300**

### After Optimization:
- Churners caught: 302 × $2,000 = **$604,000 saved** 
- Churners missed: 72 × $2,000 = **$144,000 lost**
- False positive cost: 291 × $50 = $14,550

**Net Value: $589,450**

### **ROI Improvement: $220,150 (+60% value increase!)**

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Why Sample Weights Work:
- Imbalanced dataset: ~73% No-Churn vs. ~27% Churn
- Sample weights upweight minority class (Churn) during training
- Model learns to pay more attention to churn patterns
- Formula: weight = n_samples / (n_classes × n_samples_per_class)

### Why Threshold 0.35 Was Chosen:
- Default threshold: 0.5 (balanced for 50/50 class distribution)
- Our dataset: 73/27 split → optimal threshold lower than 0.5
- 0.35 threshold balances:
  - High recall (80.75% - catch most churners)
  - Acceptable precision (50.93% - avoid too many false alarms)
  - Improved F1-score (62.46%)

### Trade-off Analysis:
- **Gain:** +115 churners saved (80.75% vs 50% recall)
- **Cost:** +197 unnecessary retention offers (50.93% vs 66.55% precision)
- **Net:** Positive ROI due to customer LTV >> retention cost
