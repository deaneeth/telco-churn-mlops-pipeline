## 📊 Final Model Performance

### Recall-Optimized Metrics
| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Recall** | **80.75%** | **+61% improvement** (50% → 80.75%) |
| **F1-Score** | **62.46%** | +14.5% improvement |
| **ROC-AUC** | **84.45%** | -0.25% (minimal trade-off) |
| **Precision** | 50.93% | Acceptable for churn use case |
| **Accuracy** | 74.24% | Business-aligned metric |

### Business Impact
- **ROI**: **+$220,150/year** (23:1 return ratio)
- **Additional Churners Caught**: 115 per 1,409 customers
- **False Negatives**: 179 → 72 (60% reduction)
- **Cost Justification**: $2,000 LTV vs $50 retention cost

### Confusion Matrix (Recall-Optimized)
```
Predicted:     No Churn    Churn
Actual No:        744       291  (FP increased, cost-effective)
Actual Yes:        72       302  (FN reduced by 60% - KEY WIN)
```

**Only 72 churners missed** vs 179 baseline!
